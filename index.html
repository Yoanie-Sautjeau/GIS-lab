        						<p> Geographic Information System (GIS) is a framework to gather, manage, analyze and visualize geographical data. GIS integrates various types of data such as satellite imagery, maps, demographics, and environmental factors. The data are geographically referenced, meaning they are associated with locations on the Earth's surface. Their integration allows analysts to overlay, compare, and analyze data from various sources. </p>


        						<p>Maps generated through GIS can display complex information in a visually intuitive format, which is particularly useful in communication and decision-making. Additionally, GIS can be used to model and predict real-world scenarios based on spatial data analysis. By simulating scenarios and predicting outcomes, GIS aids in planning and forecasting future events and developments. </p>
        							

								<p>GIS finds applications in multiple fields such as Urban Planning and Development, Natural Resource Management, Disaster Management, Public Health, Environmental Analysis, and even Transportation and Logistics. </p>

<hr>

								<p> During the Summer Course offered by the Geoscience Faculty ofUtrecht University to UCU students, I discovered over an intense two weeks what GIS is, how to use it, and its practical applications through real-world examples. I also used my newly acquired skills to better understand the NO2 pollution data monitored at Utrecht Science Park during my first Summer Course. </p>

           				 <p>I am a first-year student at University College Utrecht.

UCU is an international undergraduate Liberal Arts and Sciences honors college affiliated with Utrecht University.

The interdisciplinary nature of the curriculum has allowed me to forge my own path and pursue an interdisciplinary major bridging sciences and social sciences. I am majoring in Environmental Sciences and Human Geography.

My interests naturally led me to the GIS summer course, where I learned a lot and acquired basic technical skills that better helped me understand how maps are created.</p>
